## 🚀 About Me  

I am a Space Engineering MSc student at the University of Miskolc with a background in Mechanical Engineering.  
My primary focus areas include **fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification phenomena** under extreme or space-like conditions.  
I aim to combine **CFD analysis** with **space materials research** to simulate and optimize thermal and propulsion systems for space applications.  

I enjoy working with tools such as:  
- 🧩 **ANSYS Fluent / CFX** for CFD and thermal simulations  
- ⚙️ **SolidWorks** for geometry and design  
- 📊 **MATLAB / Python** for data analysis and automation
